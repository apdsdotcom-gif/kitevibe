        Kite Vibe is a creative community from gokite.ai.

This website is unofficial, but it will be a platform for ideas, collaboration, and community workâ€”with a warm, classic, and modern retro feel.

The goal is to contribute and provide a different feel through interactions like the ones already available:

Kite Hat Studio: Created to produce hats with the Gokite logo that you can use for profile photos or post to show your community membership.
Kite Fly Game: A light game just for fun and made more interesting by the badges.
Kite Frame: This is a frame featuring top Gokite community members who have done amazing work on X and Discord.

Build with the community, Fly Together, Create Together, and we'd love to hear from you all.

If you have interesting ideas to implement or suggestions, you can contact me on Twitter : <a href="https://x.com/Agus_pamungkasS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agus Pamungkas DS</a>.
